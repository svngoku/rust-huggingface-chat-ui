# UI Freezing Fix

## Problem
The screen was freezing when sending messages because the API call to the chat completion service was synchronous/blocking. The `client.chat_completion(req)` call at line 421 was executed on the main thread, which also handles UI updates. This caused the entire application to become unresponsive while waiting for the API response.

## Solution
The fix implements a non-blocking approach using Tokio channels:

1. **Async Communication**: When a message is sent, instead of making a blocking API call, we:
   - Create an unbounded mpsc channel for communication
   - Spawn the API call in a background tokio task
   - The background task sends the result through the channel

2. **Non-blocking Processing**: The main event loop now:
   - Checks for API responses using `try_recv()` (non-blocking)
   - Processes responses when available
   - Keeps the UI responsive throughout

3. **Shared Client**: The OpenAIClient is wrapped in an `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counter) to safely share it between the main thread and the background task.

## Key Changes

### Before (Blocking):
```rust
// This blocked the UI thread
match self.client.chat_completion(req) {
    Ok(response) => { /* handle response */ }
    Err(e) => { /* handle error */ }
}
```

### After (Non-blocking):
```rust
// Create channel for communication
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::unbounded_channel();
self.api_receiver = Some(rx);

// Clone client for background task
let client = self.client.clone();

// Spawn background task for API call
tokio::spawn(async move {
    match client.chat_completion(req) {
        Ok(response) => { tx.send(ApiMessage::Response(content)) }
        Err(e) => { tx.send(ApiMessage::Error(error_msg)) }
    }
});
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

3. **Test responsiveness**:
   - Press `i` to enter input mode
   - Type a message and press `Enter`
   - While the loading indicator shows, try:
     - Scrolling up/down with arrow keys
     - Pressing `h` to toggle help
     - The UI should remain responsive

4. **Verify the fix**:
   - The loading spinner should appear without freezing
   - You can still interact with the UI while waiting
   - The message appears when the API responds
   - Error handling still works correctly

## Performance Improvements

- **Tick Rate**: Reduced from 250ms to 100ms for better responsiveness
- **Non-blocking I/O**: API calls no longer block the UI thread
- **Efficient Polling**: Using `try_recv()` to check for responses without blocking

## Error Handling

The fix maintains all existing error handling:
- Network errors are properly caught
- API errors (401, 404, 429) show helpful messages
- Failed requests remove the user message
- Connection losses are detected and reported

## Conclusion

The application now remains fully responsive during API calls. Users can:
- Continue scrolling through messages
- Access help and other features
- See a loading indicator
- Cancel operations if needed

This provides a much better user experience compared to the previous blocking behavior.
